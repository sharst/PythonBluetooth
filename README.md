# PythonBluetooth # 

A python API to a packet-based Bluetooth connection. In combination with BluetoothFramework, it provides a stable Bluetooth link to Android devices. 
The TestBluetooth.py file demonstrates its use. This demo application should work out of the box with the PythonFrameworkDemo Application. 

This package is still work in progress. At the moment it just provides the basic functionality of creating and sending framed packets.
